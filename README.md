# SentinelPost
A Personalized, Safe AI News Platform

SentinelPost is an open-source project aimed at building a personalized, inclusive news platform that leverages the power of modern AI techniques. Our primary objective is to provide users with curated, summarized, and safe news content based on their preferences. Everyone is welcome to contribute to this project, to learn and grow together, and to make news consumption more accessible and engaging for everyone.

Key Features

Content Curation and Personalization: The platform utilizes a recommendation system to curate news feeds personalized to each user's preferences, interests, and past behavior.

Multimodal Summarization: The system leverages BART for text summarization and CLIP for visual summary (thumbnail or short video clip) generation.

Toxic Content Detection and Removal: A toxicity detection module is integrated into the pipeline to ensure content safety by filtering out toxic text, image, or video content.
